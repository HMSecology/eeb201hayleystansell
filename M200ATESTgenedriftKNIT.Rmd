This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
#M200A GENETIC DRIFT EXERCISES,Dr. Kirk Lohmueller, Fall 2015
#Hayley Stansell
#
#
getwd()
#
?rbinom
rbinom(3,10,0.1)
#3 random vars from a binom dist. 1st draw = 1/10 success, 2nd = 2/10 success, 3rd = 0/10 success
#[1] 1 2 0
rbinom
#just the function w/ nothing returns a summary of rbinom
#
#
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
